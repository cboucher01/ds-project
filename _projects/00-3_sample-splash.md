## GIS Storymap example

The US National Parks are important natural landmarks. 

This ArcGIS Storymap was made by the US National Park Service and found on the [esri website, linked here](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/). To embed your own storymap, simply go to the esri website for ArcGIS and find the StoryMap that you want to embed. Then, click the "share" symbol in the upper righthand corner (constellation of three dots), and copy and paste the html code into your own markdown file in the YAML front matter. For example, the front matter for this page contains the following code line: 

```yaml
code: <iframe width="100%" height="800" src="https://story.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=f4fd10e5f8d24d0eb7a02e33fa4c03f5" frameborder="0" scrolling="yes"> 
```

This page is on "layout: splash" (defined in the front matter), which makes the page wider and more compatible with large embedded media displays, such as this one. Additionally, you can adjust the size by changing the width percentage.
